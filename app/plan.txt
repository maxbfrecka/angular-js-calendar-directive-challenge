- constructs a value from the information placed into the date-nav
(using a directive I think)

-> selector on page is set to current date when loaded (presentDate)
	-date : month / year (11 / 2016) -> into selector (2 way data binding)
	? how to get it into the selector ?
	-can set options to a value (11) and display month name along with
	-when information is updated, calendar automatically displays new info


-> date selected generates month and year for the date to be displayed (newDate)

-> date information is collected into object




-> date information is displayed in table
	(HOW!!!!!?????)
->but how to color the days that are in the month that aren't included...?
(do a check to see if the month = month in the DATE - if so, color one way. if not, another way)

I think I need to try to learn more about directives to do this.

for DAY in DAYS - > day in the table - > rows of seven!




NOW!:
load page : correct date displayed
load 






controller sets default at load (placeholder in the SELECT box)

nav directive:


year [calculate a range of + and - 20 years to list]

<ng-repeat (from 1996-2036 ex)>
	<option year="{{x}}">{{x}}</option>



for months just write them out I guess



now, you need to bind the data both ways


lastly, you need to ensure that when the user changes the choice in select box that it automatically updates the page



dataFactory.year = dateNav year
(sets the date data from the info in view)

->how would i make it so that the info updates when the user selections something?





steps to finish:
-how to register a form change event in nav directive
(which will trigger a change in the respective data [date] pr [year])
(by taking the new value that is selected and sending it to the datafactory)
(and then update the range data)
(and then to update the variables in the directive calendar scope and reflect this in the view)

-set the current date on page load by using DEFAULT VALUE in the form itself


-how to register form change event
-how to get the data in the form
-how to set the default value in the form to 




----> study the volume slider in the example



---> seems that
















LAST STEPS:
-GET MONTH DATA TO WORK WITH SCOPE AND PASS PROPERLY
-GET THE VIEW TO UPDATE ON CHANGES



-> I may need to change this to make it work
